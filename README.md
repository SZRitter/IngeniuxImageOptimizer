# Ingeniux Image Optimizer

This is really just a small shell around Imageflow Server. It is meant to be run as a virtual application in IIS, under a name like "optimizedImages".

## Basic Setup

Deploy this to a folder in IIS and update the appsettings.json. Then create the virtual application in IIS to run this from. Alternatively, you could probably run it as a subdomain if you wanted.
